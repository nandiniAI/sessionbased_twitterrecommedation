We oppose trump b/c of: ACA repeal & sabotage GOP tax scam EPA sabotage His lies Emoluments Separating kids from parents His white nationalism & racism Etc What are other reasons for resisting trump?
2019-03-25 03:17:34,Caffeinefreak,WE DEMAND FULL TRANSPARENCY!! WE THE PEOPLE DESERVE THE FULL TRUTH!
2019-03-25 03:18:05,Caffeinefreak,The worst thing about all of this is tomorrow's Monday.
2019-03-25 03:18:56,Caffeinefreak,It doesn’t matter what the Mueller report says. Trump and his cult have already shown who they are in the last 2 years. They are monsters. Their lies and hatred shall never be forgotten or forgiven.
2019-03-25 03:19:43,Caffeinefreak,"""Where do broken hearts go""...on a loop at the Urgent Care clinic. This will take care of my ear infection cause I'm bout ready to kill myself."
2019-03-25 03:20:21,Caffeinefreak,"The reasons I’m unfazed by the Barr letter: 1) I expected Mueller’s report to be an analysis 2) Barr’s whitewash of the report was foreseeable; Mueller would have foreseen it 3) The real action is outside Mueller’s scope in SDNY, etc. Not surprised by today or fazed by it."
2019-03-25 03:22:03,Caffeinefreak,"With all due respect, I think many of you are jumping the gun with your reaction to Barr's letter regarding the Mueller Report. There is a reason he stressed that it does not exonerate Trump. Stay tuned.."
2019-03-25 02:02:12,Caffeinefreak,This about sums it up tonight with the Mueller report delivered
2019-03-25 03:10:12,Caffeinefreak,"Because I’m pretty sure I was going to be sent to Gitmo with @TheRickWilson but If QAnon is off now, does this mean we go free or no?"
2019-03-25 03:09:11,Caffeinefreak,Is everyone totally bummed out because of Mueller and Barr? I am
2019-03-25 03:08:52,Caffeinefreak,I'll have an op-ed up shortly about AG Barr's troubling attempt to resolve the obstruction of justice charges (in 48 hours) when Mueller didn't resolve it (in nearly 2 years). 
2019-03-25 03:08:04,Caffeinefreak,I will never believe the “adoptions” meeting in trump tower was about adoptions. That alone is a reason we need to see the full report. That needs to be explained to me.
2019-03-25 03:07:55,Caffeinefreak,"OMFG at Urgent care bc of ear infection and they're playing ""I'm Your Lady"" by Celine...loud My headache is getting worse by the second. If she belts out another shrill...I'm gonna runamuck all up in here!"
2019-03-25 03:07:24,Caffeinefreak,They absolutely have to. This is beyond absurd!
2019-03-25 03:06:47,Caffeinefreak,"The House Judicial Committee can demand public testimony! And we watch the refusals , which becomes court ordered subpeonas."
2019-03-25 02:40:55,Caffeinefreak,A good outcome: 1. The investigation was able to proceed lawfully to its conclusion. 2. Our president did not conspire with a hostile power to win his election. 3. The evidence in the report on obstruction by the president while in office will confirm he ought not be re-elected.
2019-03-25 02:40:02,Caffeinefreak,"Is Donald tweeting? I block the loony, but I think he's tweeting. Ppl are tweeting him suddenly, that's usually a sign of another orange, loser man-baby eruption."
2019-03-25 02:39:34,Caffeinefreak,"I did not join The Resistance bc of Trump’s dealings with Russia. I joined because he represents all things wrong with this world: Greed, racism, bigotry, sexism and a far right ideology that deserves no vote. So I say: let’s roll up our sleeves and focus on 2020."
2019-03-25 02:38:59,Caffeinefreak,Look up your local Dem group and volunteer. Get plugged in with postcards to voters. What is a topic you care about and go see your congresspeople. How we can start lobbying and advocating for ourselves? 
2019-03-25 02:38:04,Caffeinefreak,"Hey! You feel like sh*t, right? Get over it (after you've had a necessary amount of time, alcohol, hiding under your covers and/or pastries) and figure out what we can do to make a difference. Maybe it isn't on Twitter - although I believe there is value here"
2019-03-25 02:37:55,Caffeinefreak,So now I suppose we just settle in with the fact that America has been destroyed and it’s remnants are being led by a horror show of a human being. Right? No. Fuck no we don’t.
2019-03-25 02:37:21,Caffeinefreak,"My English professor is someowhere in a corner, going nuts with all the double negatives. If you read it how it is wrote, he is guilty."
2019-03-25 02:36:32,Caffeinefreak,Voting blue no matter who
2019-03-25 02:35:45,Caffeinefreak,We know almost nothing more about Mueller’s findings than we did before Barr’s letter.
2019-03-25 02:34:52,Caffeinefreak,Barr is guilty as fuck.
2019-03-25 02:34:01,Caffeinefreak,"If the Mueller report totally exonerated Trump, we would all be reading it in its entirety right now. And he would be holding a televised victory rally right now. This is not over. #MuellerReport"

2019-03-25 02:30:10,Caffeinefreak,"JUST IN: Rep. Jerry Nadler tweets that ""in light of the very concerning discrepancies and final decision making at the Justice Department following the Special Counsel report,"" the House Judiciary Committee will be calling AG William Barr to testify."
2019-03-25 02:29:33,Caffeinefreak,the summary is irrelevant - only the full report matters #ReleaseTheEntireReport

2019-03-25 02:27:22,Caffeinefreak,Today’s lesson if you’re rich and powerful the laws don’t apply to you. This was always about the rich getting away with everything and not being held accountable for anything. This is how we win in 2020. They just gave us the theme. #VoteBlueNoMatterWho
2019-03-25 02:26:44,Caffeinefreak,Caffeinefreak
2019-03-25 02:26:00,Caffeinefreak,Trump's already lying. He said he's totally exonerated. Mueller's report specifically said it doesn't rule out exoneration. IT'S STARTED ALREADY.
2019-03-25 02:25:32,Caffeinefreak,You’re not exonerated.
2019-03-25 02:24:47,Caffeinefreak,Donald Trump proclaims he's been declared 'exonerated' -- despite Mueller not exonerating him
2019-03-25 02:23:57,Caffeinefreak,Because that's all she does - learned it from her Fuhrer
2019-03-25 02:23:10,Caffeinefreak,"Why are you lying? It specifically says that they did not make that decision, Barr did. Next up: Congressional oversight."
2019-03-25 01:40:19,Caffeinefreak,We now know for certain that Barr is partisan beyond a shadow of a doubt. Congress must remove him.
2019-03-25 01:39:59,Caffeinefreak,I feel like I just lost a 2 year erection. #MuellerReport
2019-03-25 01:39:22,Caffeinefreak,Did Barr just commit obstruction of justice himself?
2019-03-25 01:38:32,Caffeinefreak,This settles it. I'm trapped in a parallel universe that is completely insane.
2019-03-25 01:37:44,Caffeinefreak,"""Not to make traditional prosecutorial judgment."" Meaning AG Barr made this decision because WHY? Because he doesn't want to upset tRump? We need the full report to see why this decision was made. Too vague."
2019-03-25 01:37:11,Caffeinefreak,"“The Special Counsel states that ‘while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.’”"
2019-03-25 01:36:22,Caffeinefreak,"DOJ has just sent us a very brief letter about the Mueller report, which we will share shortly."
2019-03-25 01:35:10,Caffeinefreak,Black people have gotten 25 years to life with far less evidence than Trump and Russia conspiracy produced. 
2019-03-25 01:34:59,Caffeinefreak,"Re the Mueller report, Barr's letter states: ""While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”"
2019-03-25 01:34:22,Caffeinefreak,Why did Paul Manafort share highly confidential polling data with Russian intelligence? #Mueller #Barr What did the Russians do with it and which states/Americans were targeted with that data as a result? I fucking want to know
2019-03-25 01:34:03,Caffeinefreak,"I am in tears. RIP, this once great Republic...taken down by an ignorant, vicious, sick man. Who would have EVER thought this could happen? I don't know this country anymore."
2019-03-25 01:33:44,Caffeinefreak,It’s impossible to believe. Has the Resistance been misled? Is it a ruse to calm the waters? Have they decided it’s too hard to prove intent & will indict w/ financial crimes? Trying to keep hope alive. @BarackObama @EricHolder @MalcolmNance Please say we’ll-be okay!
2019-03-25 01:33:08,Caffeinefreak,"Wrap up my walk and hop in the car. On the road out, I bump into this guy. He’s a gyrafalcon/prairie falcon mix. His falconer was taking him out for a little exercise. That’s one cool bird. And as we were talking, a peregrine flew over us. Bird nerd stokedness level: high"
2019-03-25 01:32:53,Caffeinefreak,I'm not sure how Trump celebrates the Barr letter. Mueller concludes that Russia helped him significantly but no proof of government coordination and no exoneration from obstruction investigation. He accepted that help and tried to obstruct the investigation. #ReleaseTheReport
2019-03-25 01:30:22,Caffeinefreak,"RE: obstruction of justice, Barr again quotes Mueller report: ""while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."""
2019-03-25 01:30:00,Caffeinefreak,Trump knew this was coming. He knew the report favored him. That's why he has been silent. I'm so fucking pissed right now
2019-03-25 01:29:54,Caffeinefreak,So Barr & Rosenstein determined there was insufficient evidence to proceed. That was easy. (snort)
2019-03-25 01:29:02,Caffeinefreak,"While it may very well be the case, we need to see the report. This is just AG Barr’s summary."
2019-03-25 01:28:52,Caffeinefreak,"So, now, I’d really, really like to see the actual report, not Barr’s summary of it. /5"
2019-03-25 01:28:09,Caffeinefreak,Questions I have for the Mueller version: - Couldn’t establish connection to Russian *government* is doing important work here - “underlying crime?” - does not exonerate? Why that phrasing? /2
2019-03-25 01:27:43,Caffeinefreak,"Mueller made the report... Barr made the conclusions... If there is no collusion or obstruction then I want to read it from the report, not hear it from Barr."
2019-03-25 01:26:55,Caffeinefreak,"Mueller Report: No Collusion. No Obstruction. I beleive the report. But, all you Dem. Congressmen, MSM legal experts who have told us for two years that you have seen enough evidence to convict Trump of both collusion and obstruction, I will never believe you ever again!!!"
2019-03-25 01:26:04,Caffeinefreak,Anybody else watching MSNBC right now? Cause im not sure how to take all this. I’m on the verge of breaking shit but I’m trying to remain calm
2019-03-25 01:25:49,Caffeinefreak,Guess Trump literally confessing on TV doesn't count.
2019-03-25 01:25:10,Caffeinefreak,We all knew he had stacked the deck so he would get away with it. That does not make any of his myriad of impeachable offenses any less dire. It’s up to us. We have to rise up and demand he be removed.
2019-03-25 01:24:40,Caffeinefreak,To clarify: we’re not done yet. When I say “this is a bunch of horseshit” I’m referring to this 4 page paper. I’ll compose some thoughts on this later. For now I’m going to go curse at the folks to told me to give Barr the benefit of the doubt
2019-03-25 01:24:04,Caffeinefreak,"So, this is a bunch of horseshit. Mueller left it up to main justice to decide if Trump obstructed justice, and they (Barr/Rosenstein) decided no, even though he’s on tape admitting that he obstructed justice?"
2019-03-25 01:23:44,Caffeinefreak,Pretty sure Donald is dancing on Air Force One right now. It’s up to us to vote him out in November 2020.
2019-03-25 01:22:24,Caffeinefreak,The Barr Letter says Mueller did not make a determination of whether Trump obstructed justice. It sets out both sides. But Barr concludes— on his determination — that there was no obstruction. How did he do that without trying to interview Trump? Full report now needs to come out
